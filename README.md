# PPE_Detection
I'm making a program that detects whether or not someone is wearing PPE or not from an image

The files necessary to conduct this project is located in this kaggle link: 

Furthermore, the project is conducted using google colab for ease of execution in correlation with the google drive, however, I've attached a .ipynb file just for ease of access and convenience in the src.

Unfortunately, for the sake of my limited space in google drive, I've decided to move my dataset to kaggle, however the results of the project has been finalized and I am pleased with the results. To train it, simply run the .ipynb file and take the output which is (best.pt or last.pt) and copy it to your local directory so that it can be used in the .py file.
